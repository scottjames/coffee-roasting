Why Automation Failed Here

Automated profiles are typically designed for:

 -  Specific batch sizes (likely 400-500g)
 -  Specific bean densities
 -  Specific roast levels
 -  Your machine's typical thermal properties

Using a profile designed for larger batches on a 150g load resulted in:

 -  Too much heat energy for bean mass
 -  Inability to control development
 -  Runaway into second crack


Critical Recommendations

1. Batch Size and Charge Temperature Relationship

For your 500g capacity roaster:

    150g batch: Charge at 130-140°C BT maximum
    250g batch: Charge at 140-150°C BT
    400-500g batch: Charge at 150-160°C BT

Never charge at 200°C for a 150g batch.

2. Proper Preheat Protocol

For 150g batches:

    Preheat drum to 160-170°C (measure with probe inside)
    Charge beans at 100% power
    Target charge BT: 130-135°C
    Beans will cool the drum down on contact
    TP should occur around 1:30-2:00

3. Target Profile for Next Attempt

For 150g City to City+:

    0:00 - Charge at 130-135°C BT
    1:45 - Turning point at 110-115°C BT
    4:30 - Dry end at 145-150°C BT
    8:00 - First crack at 172-175°C BT
    9:30-10:00 - Drop at 202-207°C BT
    Total time: 9:30-10:30

4. Power Management

    Start 100% at charge
    Reduce to 70% at 1:00
    Reduce to 65% at 3:00
    Reduce to 60% at 5:00
    Reduce to 55% at 7:00
    Reduce to 50% at FC
    Monitor and adjust for gentle decline

Overall plan:

    0:00  - Charge at 130-135°C BT, 100% power
    1:45  - TP at 110-115°C BT, reduce to 70%
    3:00  - Reduce to 65%
    4:30  - Dry end ~145-150°C, reduce to 60%
    6:00  - Reduce to 55%
    7:30  - Reduce to 50%
    8:00  - FC starts ~172-175°C, reduce to 45%
    9:30  - Drop at 202-207°C BT
