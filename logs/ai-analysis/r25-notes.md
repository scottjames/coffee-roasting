# Coffee Roast Analysis: Columbia El Mirador Pink Bourbon (Roast #3)

## Roast Overview

**Bean:** Columbia El Mirador Pink Bourbon (GCX-8272)  
**Target:** City to City+  
**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Batch:** 150g green → 123g roasted (18% weight loss)  
**Total Time:** 7:49 (469.5 seconds)

**Your notes:** "started with hot drum around 200c, kept heat, little browning, ran into FC... afraid of no maillard, and too much devel. this was too fast. 200c too much for only 150 gram batch."

## Critical Analysis: This Roast Failed

Your own notes are accurate - **this roast went catastrophically wrong**. Let me explain what happened:

### The Disaster Timeline

- **Charge BT:** 197.4°C - **WAY too hot** (should be 130-135°C)
- **Turning Point:** 1:25 at 151.4°C BT - ridiculously hot
- **First Crack:** 4:49 at 178°C BT - barely 3 minutes after TP
- **Second Crack:** 7:36 at 199.7°C BT
- **Drop:** 7:49 at 200.9°C BT

### What Actually Happened

You charged beans into a drum at nearly **200°C** - this is like throwing beans into an oven:

1. **Instant scorching** - beans hit 197°C immediately
2. **No proper drying phase** - beans skipped straight to Maillard
3. **Compressed development** - entire roast in under 8 minutes
4. **Runaway roast** - temperature momentum carried you into second crack

Your phase breakdown shows the problem:
- **Drying phase:** 253.5 seconds (54%) but at dangerously high temps
- **Maillard phase:** Only 36 seconds (8%) - **THIS IS THE PROBLEM**
- **Development phase:** 180 seconds (38%)

### The Maillard Catastrophe

**36 seconds of Maillard phase is roasting malpractice.** You need 3:30-4:30 minutes, not 36 seconds. This is where sweetness, complexity, and body develop. Without it, you get:

- Burnt, scorched exterior
- Underdeveloped, grassy interior
- No sweetness or complexity
- Bitter, acrid flavors
- Thin body despite high weight loss

### The Numbers Tell the Story

- **18% weight loss** - extremely high, indicating severe over-roasting
- **Drop at 200.9°C BT** - well into second crack (French roast territory)
- **Total time 7:49** - absurdly fast for proper development
- **Defects noted:** "drops" and "uneven" - confirming uneven roasting

## What This Coffee Tastes Like

This batch is likely:
- Extremely bitter and acrid
- Burnt/charred flavors
- Thin, astringent body
- No sweetness or origin character
- Possibly undrinkable
- Uneven development (scorched outside, underdeveloped inside)

## ET Probe Update

I notice you installed the ET probe properly ("put ET wire through top of hopper door, poking 2 inches into drum space"). Good! But look at your ET readings:

- **Charge ET:** 273°C - absurdly hot
- **Drop ET:** 234°C - still extremely hot

This confirms the drum was massively overheated.

## Root Cause Analysis

You correctly identified the problem in your notes: **"200c too much for only 150 gram batch."**

What went wrong:
1. You preheated the drum to ~200°C for a 150g batch
2. This is appropriate for a 500g batch, not 150g
3. Small batches need MUCH lower charge temps (130-140°C max)
4. Once you charged, the thermal mass of the hot drum overwhelmed the small bean mass
5. Beans cooked too fast with no chance for proper development

## Why You Made This Mistake

Looking at your previous roasts:
- Roast #1: Dropped at 178°C after 10:16
- Roast #2: Dropped at 188°C after 10:58
- You were trying to go darker/faster

But instead of controlled heat management, you **massively overshot** by starting way too hot.

## Critical Recommendations

### 1. **Batch Size and Charge Temperature Relationship**

For your 500g capacity roaster:
- **150g batch:** Charge at 130-140°C BT maximum
- **250g batch:** Charge at 140-150°C BT
- **400-500g batch:** Charge at 150-160°C BT

**Never charge at 200°C for a 150g batch.**

### 2. **Proper Preheat Protocol**

For 150g batches:
- Preheat drum to 160-170°C (measure with probe inside)
- Charge beans at 100% power
- Target charge BT: 130-135°C
- Beans will cool the drum down on contact
- TP should occur around 1:30-2:00

### 3. **Target Profile for Next Attempt**

**For 150g City to City+:**
- **0:00** - Charge at 130-135°C BT
- **1:45** - Turning point at 110-115°C BT
- **4:30** - Dry end at 145-150°C BT
- **8:00** - First crack at 172-175°C BT
- **9:30-10:00** - Drop at 202-207°C BT
- **Total time:** 9:30-10:30

### 4. **Power Management**

- Start 100% at charge
- Reduce to 70% at 1:00
- Reduce to 65% at 3:00
- Reduce to 60% at 5:00
- Reduce to 55% at 7:00
- Reduce to 50% at FC
- Monitor and adjust for gentle decline

## Comparing Your Three Roasts

| Metric | Roast #1 | Roast #2 | Roast #3 |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Charge BT | 134°C | 133°C | **197°C** |
| TP Time | 1:04 | 0:55 | 1:25 |
| Total Time | 10:16 | 10:58 | **7:49** |
| Drop BT | 178°C | 188°C | **201°C** |
| Weight Loss | 16% | 16% | **18%** |
| Maillard Time | ~200s | ~258s | **36s** |
| Result | OK | Dark | **Disaster** |

## The Path Forward

Your roasting notes show good self-awareness - you recognized the mistake immediately. Here's what to do:

1. **Forget this roast happened** - it's a learning experience, not a reflection of your ability
2. **Go back to roast #1 approach** - that was your best roast so far
3. **Focus on consistency** - charge at 130-135°C every time for 150g
4. **Be patient** - 9-10 minute roasts are appropriate for this batch size
5. **Trust the process** - don't try to speed things up

## One Positive Note

Your ET probe installation worked! The data shows it's now tracking properly inside the drum. This means you can actually use both BT and ET data going forward, which will greatly improve your roast control.

## Bottom Line

This roast is undrinkable and should be discarded. You charged into a drum that was 60-70°C too hot, compressed the Maillard phase to nothing, and ended up with burnt, underdeveloped beans. 

**Your mistake was simple:** Wrong charge temperature for batch size.

**Your fix is simple:** Charge at 130-135°C for 150g batches, no matter what.

Don't be discouraged - every roaster has made this mistake. You recognized it immediately, which shows you're learning. Your next roast will be better because now you understand the relationship between batch size and charge temperature.
