# S curve

Notes from chatgpt:


The S-curve is not just cosmetic — it signals controlled heat transfer and balanced development:

 - A smooth S-curve means consistent, stable roasting with no “crashes” (sudden RoR drops) or “flicks” (sudden spikes).
 - A crash after first crack often leads to baked or flat-tasting coffee.
 - A flick near the end can lead to harsh, bitter notes.
