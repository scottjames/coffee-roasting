# Precision 500g roaster notes

## Artisan usage:

With empty machine (no beans) in summer (85F outside)

Heat | Air  | ROR
-----|------|-----
  20 |  --  |  dont use.
  30 |  50  |  -2 dont use. emergency cooling
  40 |  50  |  0 (level)
  50 |  50  |  6-8
  60 |  50  |  10 (after CHG)
  70 |  50  |  12-14 (after CHG)
  80 |  --  |  dont use


- Keep machine AIR=50
- Modulate BURNER= 40,45,50 for mild ROR around 3 - 5 after DE
- Charge lower temp, around 135F (150gm) or 140F (200gm)
- After charge, set higher BURNER heat around 60 - 70
- After TP set BURNER heat around 50
- After DE, use 50 - 40 settings.

Based on Kaleido video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nweTp-TiZ4
- Aim for TP of 0:45 - 0:60 to avoid roast defects, but also build roast momentum.

## Target:

** batch size 150 grams **

- DRY for 3:30 - 4:00
- BRN for 2:00 - 2:30 (longer looses flavor)
- DEV for 2:30 - 3:00 (longer looses flavor, shorter makes bitterness)
- DROP around 10:00 - 10:30 (longer looses flavor)
- Enter DE with ROR of 8 - 10
- Enter FC with ROR of 3 - 5 (but <= 5, not more! else bitterness)

## For Dark Roast:

See [dark roast tips](dark-roast-tips.md) for detailed discussion

- After FC Keep ROR <= 5
- Target time 12:00 or less (13:00 is baked)
- Target drop temp 200, but OK if not reached.
