# Notes on ROR Crash and Flick


 - From https://www.baristahustle.com/lesson/htr-3-03-approaching-first-crack/#:~:text=We'll%20explore%20the%20importance,should%20continue%20to%20gradually%20decrease.

To prevent the RoR from flatlining when you are roasting washed coffees, you should decrease
the gas setting around 45 seconds before the start of first crack. The gas setting should
be low enough to keep the RoR decreasing but not so low that the roast loses momentum
and the bean temperature stops increasing before the end of the roast. Lowering the gas
setting any later risks a worse potential crash in the RoR.

About 45 seconds after the start of first crack, begin gradually decreasing the gas
settings again. A good starting point is to:

 * cut the gas by about half once the development time ratio (DTR) reaches 12%,
 * cut it in half again at 14% and
 * cut in half again at 16%.

This ensures that the gas setting by the end of the roast is low enough to
prevent a flick, which often begins at 16–17% DTR.

Naturally processed coffees are much less likely to crash, so your approach to gas
 settings for these coffees doesn’t need to be as rigid. It’s possible to continue
 lowering the gas settings in the early stages of first crack without causing a crash.
