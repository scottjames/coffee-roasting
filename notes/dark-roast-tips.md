The answer depends on what roast defects you're trying to avoid and what flavor profile you're targeting. Each metric addresses different risks in dark roasting:

## The Three Metrics and What They Control

**Drop Temperature (195-205°C)**
- Controls: Roast degree, flavor development, oil production
- Risk if prioritized alone: Can cause baking (long time at temp) or scorching (rushing to hit temp)

**Time Limit (11:30-13:00)**
- Controls: Overall roast pace, prevents stalling/baking
- Risk if prioritized alone: Can cause tipping/scorching if you rush, or underdevelopment if you limit too strictly

**RoR Curve (4-6°C/min in development)**
- Controls: Even heat application, prevents scorching and tipping
- Risk if prioritized alone: May not reach desired darkness if too conservative

## The Right Hierarchy for Dark Roasts

**Primary Priority: RoR Control (4-6°C/min in development)**

This is your safety metric. Maintaining controlled RoR prevents the two worst dark roast defects:
- Scorching (from heat spikes)
- Tipping (from excessive heat on bean edges)
- Internal underdevelopment (dark outside, light inside)

If your RoR exceeds 7°C/min post-first crack, you're risking quality regardless of when or where you drop.

**Secondary Priority: Time Window (11:30-13:00)**

This prevents baking. If you're approaching 13:00 and haven't hit target temperature, you're baking the coffee. Better to drop slightly lighter than continue roasting with insufficient heat.

If you're hitting target temp before 11:00, you rushed and likely have defects.

**Tertiary Priority: Drop Temperature (195-205°C)**

This is your target, not your controller. The temperature tells you where you are on the darkness spectrum, but HOW you got there matters more than the number itself.

## Practical Decision Framework

**Scenario 1: At 11:45, you're at 193°C with 5°C/min RoR**
- Decision: Drop now
- Why: Good RoR, reasonable time, close to target temp
- Result: Slightly lighter than planned but quality roast

**Scenario 2: At 11:00, you're at 198°C with 8°C/min RoR**
- Decision: Drop immediately
- Why: RoR too high = scorching risk, regardless of "perfect" time and temp
- Result: May have some defects but limiting damage

**Scenario 3: At 12:45, you're at 190°C with 3°C/min RoR**
- Decision: Increase heat or drop soon
- Why: Approaching time limit with stalling RoR = baking
- Result: Drop lighter than planned to avoid baked flavors

**Scenario 4: At 11:30, you're at 200°C with 4°C/min RoR**
- Decision: Continue to 202-205°C if desired
- Why: Everything in good ranges, can push darker safely
- Result: Achieves darker target with quality

## Why This Hierarchy Works

Dark roasts are fragile - the beans are structurally weakened, sugars are carbonizing, and the margin for error shrinks. A well-executed medium-dark roast beats a defect-ridden French roast every time.

RoR control ensures you're roasting evenly and gently through the most delicate phase. Time limits prevent the slow death of baking. Temperature is just the destination - the journey matters more.

## What This Means for Your Planning

Set up your roast to hit all three targets:
- Plan heat reductions to maintain 4-6°C/min RoR
- Target 200°C at around 12:00
- Monitor continuously and adjust

But if forced to choose: Sacrifice target temperature to maintain RoR. A Full City+ roast (197°C) with perfect RoR will taste better than a French roast (205°C) with scorching.

The reality is that excellent dark roasters hit all three metrics because they're interconnected. But when things go wrong, RoR is your safety valve.
