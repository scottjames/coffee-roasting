# Cupping R23 (bad) VS. R19 (better)

my notes from tasting R19 yesterday and R23 today.
 - R19 is ok, drinkable.  
 - R23 is bad, burnt/flat.

## R23 10/5 1708

### SPECS
 - T:  4:40 - 3:20 - 3:30   (41/29/31)
 - ROR: 7/7/7 (no glide)
 - charge BT 190 (too high)
 - TP xx/1:45 (too long?)
 - DE xx/

 - roast with "032" automatic program.
 - monitor only with artisan, no control.
 - auto preheat to 190c per "032" setting then charged.

 - **NOTE:** This 500g roaster is designed for 500 gram batch, not 150 gram batch.
 - charged WAY too hot.
 - machine had flat ROR around 7 the whole time.
 - Drop temp was good around 198c
 - DTR 41:29:31 was too short dry, too long brown, devel.
 - TP around 1:45 - too long, should be earlier around 1:30.
 - phase times should be  (5-4-3 shortened): 4:30 - 3:45 (longer) - 2:45 (shorter)

### NEXT TIME:
 - go back to charge temp 135
 - high heat at start for stronger ROR momentum ~12-15
 - Aim for better times:   around 4:30 - 3:45 - 2:45 (5-4-3 shortened)
 - drop at 200
 - total time < 11, like around 10:30

## R19 10/4 1155
### SPECS
 - T: 4:10 - 3:44 - 3:00  (38/34/28)
 - ROR: 10/7/5 good ratios
 - charge BT 132 (good)
 - TP 111/1:00 (good, or bit longer) -- needed higher heat, like B80
 - DE 144/4:10 (good, or bit longer) -- drops heat at 1:30, 2:00

### NEXT TIME
 - phase times should be  (5-4-3 shortened): 4:30 - 3:45 (same) - 2:45 (shorter)

 - preheat drum/ET around 150, wait 5 mins (not much higher ET then drop BT probe temp)
 - charge 150 grams at lower temp, around 125 - 130
 - adjust in 5% steps, not 10%.
 - stronger heat at first, 75% or 80%, drop at 30 seconds
 - use phase times 5:4:3 (for shorter?) for dry:brown:devel (but stop devel at 19 %, before 3 mins)
 - slower pace dry 5 mins, slower brown 4 mins, 
 - use whatever ROR needed to acheive timings.
 - drop at 200+ must hit 198c to avoid raw/grass flavor.

- is probe reading low? seems like temps are low for what is happening to beean.
