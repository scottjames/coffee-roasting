# Thoughts on Planning Roast Profile

https://oilslickcoffee.com/roasting/understanding-the-roast-profile/

thoughts about Dry, Maillard, Devel phases.

## Preheat and Charge

Want to hit TP around 1.5 mins at around 110c.
use whatever preheat needed for the mass of beans.
130c for 150 grams beans.

need enough drum heat to 'throw' RoR curve quickly upward for momentum.


## Dry Phase

This is about heating to remove moisture from the beans.
Water boils off at 100c.
We want to reach that point around 4.5 to 5.0 minutes.

## Maillard/Browning Phase

This kicks into overdrive around 150c.
Chocolate, Malty, Nutty flavors.
Maybe slow down during this second phase to drag it out some.

### Yellow

This is when green turns yellow around 150c.
Begin sweet smell.
citric acid starting to burn off slowly.
spend about 100 seconds here, from 450 - 550 seconds on clock.
move slower to create flavors, faster to avoid flavors.
for less sweetness, spend around 80 (not 100) seconds here, increase ROR during that temp range.

### Brown

This is when yellow turns brown around 168c.
Just before first crack.
continue and end sweet smell.
citric acid burn off more.
spend about 150 seconds here, from 600 - 750 seconds on clock.
move quickly to preserve flavors, slower to burn off flavors.
more time in brown phase to burn off citric acid - add time taken from yellow. slow ROR during temp range.
less acid by spending 180 seconds (increased from 150)

NOTE: to compare two beans, align at DE (yellow) to ignore drying, and compare at brn/dev stages.

## Development Phase

### First Crack
 - Happens around 190c.
 - Distrinct "raw" grassy flavor always there until 390f (197c)

### Second Crack
 - Happens around 222c. (430F)

DTR as: Green, Yellow, Brown, Post-FC
