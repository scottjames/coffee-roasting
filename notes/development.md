 - https://shungrill.com/article/how-long-to-roast-coffee-development

 - longer development makes more bitterness, bigger/stronger flavor.
 - sugars burn 210-220c making bitter notes

 - average roast time is 12:00 minutes. can range 8:00 to 20:00.

 - grassy/hay flavors: to short roast time, or need longer devel time. 
 - kenya is high acid, may *seem* under developed due to acid taste.

 - Underdevelopment occurs when a bean has not been thoroughly roasted,
   leading to grassy and hay-like flavours.
 - Overdevelopment, can result in a burnt-sugar bitterness.

 - In general; low and slow produces a smaller difference between ground
   and whole-bean color and hot and fast produces a larger difference between
   ground and whole-bean color.
 - lighter/brighter cup, we should ensure our roast is hot and fast...
   to preserve more of the brighter flavors still present in the
   less-cooked center of the bean.
 - For a darker/heavier cup, slow things down and spend more time in
   the Maillard’s sweet spot (~150°-190°C), to generate more caramelly,
   malty, nutty flavors
 - For a complex, light/bright coffee: roast hotter and faster
 - For a complex, dark/heavy coffee: roast slower and lower


## Notes on DTR

 - https://millcityroasters.com/blogs/coffee-articles/whats-the-best-development-time-dtr-and-finish-temperature

 - Dry (when T < 150c) (aim for < 50% of time)
 - Browning, between DE and FCS. (around 150c - 175c)
 - Development - After FCS, aim for 20% - 25% time
 - At around 190c acids break down rapidly. (Darker roasts are less acidic)
 - DTR: 50 / 30 / 20 => 5 min, 3 min, 2 min (10 min duration)
 - DTR: 50 / 33 / 17 => 6 min, 4 min, 2 min (12 min duration)

 - Finish temp is 70% of flavor, determines color.
 - color shows DROP temp. partial indicator of flavor.

"""
Your finish temp is the point of greatest velocity of chemical change in the coffee. Successfully hitting your roast flavor target means discharging the coffee into the cooling tray at the exact instant your inner and outer seed development best contributes to your choice of flavor in the cup.

It's not catching a speeding bullet. It’s catching an accelerating bullet.

## Crash and Flick

 - https://www.beanscenemag.com.au/cropster-adds-flick-prediction-to-its-ai-roasting-program/
 - software cropster.com added AI prediction for "crash and flick" after FCS.
 - it's the 'flick' causing Roasty flavors, not high DTR.
