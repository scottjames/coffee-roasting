# Enhancements for 500g roaster

This is list of things to change or improve on the 500g roaster.

- Add thermocouple for BT
- Add thermocouple for ET

- Add BME280 on TC4 interface - capture ambient Temperature/Humidity
- Add BME280 on exhaust pipe - capture output Temperature/Humidity
- then compare % humidity difference during roast

- Add IR sensor against drum to get drump temp (how to install without cooking sensor?)
- Add spectometer & light in bean window - get quantitative readings of bean color.
- Add mic to capture FC sounds - DSP to analyze pop/crack sound density. Use tube/waveguide to avoid motor noise.
