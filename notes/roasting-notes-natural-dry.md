# Roasting notes for Natural (Dry) process

(from gemini 2.5)


For a dry- or natural-processed green coffee, the roasting profile should be approached differently from a wet-processed coffee to highlight its unique characteristics, which often include fruitiness, sweetness, and a heavier body. The presence of residual sugars from the dried coffee cherry makes these beans more susceptible to scorching and a faster rate of browning.

Here is a guide to creating a roasting and Rate of Rise (RoR) profile for natural-processed coffee.

### 1. Key Roasting Characteristics

* **Residual Sugars:** The sugars from the coffee fruit are absorbed into the bean during the drying process. This can lead to a more explosive and quick Maillard reaction and caramelization, so you must be careful not to burn the outside of the bean.
* **Density and Consistency:** Natural-processed coffees can be less uniform in density and moisture content compared to washed coffees. This may require a more careful and gentle approach to ensure an even roast.
* **Flavor Profile:** The goal is to preserve the delicate fruit and fermented notes while developing a rich sweetness and body.

### 2. Roasting Profile Strategy

The roasting strategy for natural-processed coffee should focus on a slower, more controlled approach, especially in the early and middle stages, to avoid scorching and allow the sugars to caramelize properly.

* **Drying Phase (Endothermic):** This phase is crucial for natural coffees.
    * **Goal:** Carefully and slowly dry the beans to avoid scorching the outer layer. A lower charge temperature can be beneficial.
    * **RoR:** Keep the initial RoR lower than for a washed coffee to allow for more gentle heat penetration. This helps to prevent a runaway roast later on.
* **Maillard Phase (Endothermic):** This is where the browning and development of flavor occur.
    * **Goal:** Extend this phase to properly develop the sweetness and body without losing the fruity notes.
    * **RoR:** The decline in RoR should be steady and gentle. Some roasters may even "stall" the RoR to prolong this phase, but be cautious as this can also lead to "baking" the beans.
* **First Crack and Development Phase (Exothermic):**
    * **Goal:** Manage the exothermic reaction to prevent the RoR from "flicking" or spiking.
    * **RoR:** A smooth, gentle decline is the objective. Many roasters reduce heat and increase airflow at the beginning of the first crack to control the energy spike and prevent a smoky or bitter taste. A lower RoR at the start of the first crack (e.g., 5-8°F/min) can help you avoid a "baked" taste while preserving the sweetness.

### 3. Rate of Rise (RoR) Profile

A typical RoR profile for a natural-processed coffee roast would show a gentler, more controlled decline than that of a washed coffee.

1.  **Initial RoR:** A lower initial RoR (e.g., 15-20°F/min) to prevent scorching.
2.  **Middle RoR:** A smooth and consistent decline throughout the middle of the roast.
3.  **End RoR:** The RoR should continue to decline gently into the development phase, with careful management of the heat and airflow at first crack to prevent any sudden spikes.

As with any coffee roasting, these are general guidelines. The exact profile will depend on the specific bean, its density, moisture content, and your roasting equipment. You should always use your senses and log your roasts to find the best approach.
