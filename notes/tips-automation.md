set alarm at beginning as reminder to begin recording

preheat with heat=100% fan=20%

Use Alarm events:
  - "AT CHARGE" time, set heat to 50%
  - "AT CHARGE" time + 30 seconds, set heat to 85%
  - this allows time for drump temperature to normalize
  - "AT TEMP 170", set FAN up to 80% (clear smoke)

best ROR profile:
  - climb initial to 35-40, then lower to around 5-8 at end
  - linear decline
  - ROR hump in graph is a "flick and crash"
  - best roast has no ROR hump

during roast, lower heat,fan...

Two Exothermic events:
  - before 1st crack, temp will rise on own
  - before 2nd crack, temp will rise on own
  - lower temp prior to allow smooth ROR (avoid flick and crash)

Watch out for:
  - flat BT (low HEAT, high FAN) 'flat' will bake beans
