## Roasting a light roast (Willem Boot)

 - flaws: brazilian, can be peanut; kenya, sour unripe green tomato
 - flaws: sumatra malty earthy; panama thin and no flavor
 - steps for roasting light:
 - Green progress: grass, [DE] hay, bread, [MLRD], coffee, FC (steam) [DEVEL]
 - Drying Phase: lose green, moisture loss at 100 'C, starts drying phase
 - Dry End: lost green, expansion, browning starts
 - Maillard/Browning; brown evens out
 - SCA color scale more popular than Agtron.
 - Timings: 3:10/272F grass, 4:30/300F Hay, 7:00/327F Bread,
 - Timings contd: "A point" 9:00/365F pre-FC (first Aromatics); 9:45/375F FCs, 10:35/381F FCe, Drop.
 - slow vs. fast roast: slow, control burner; More air is faster; RPM high is faster;
 - Giesen default 55 rpm.  Slow down will devel slower (less convection heat)
 - batch charge is 50% is faster (too much heat for bean mass in drum)
 - timing/settings different on large/small models.
 - longer roast, could stall/bake roast.
 - ROR low (2) can devel slowly, vs. high (20) risk baking beans.
 - Devel time: FC -> Drop.
 - FC usually at specific temperature (per machine/bean)
 - Devel flavor specific to % Devel and bean;
 - **NOTE** ROR lower prior to FCs to avoid pyrolysis (self heating)
 - faster roast can vary flavor/colors, slower is better.
 - Light #1: DTR: 33/40/35  over 8:30; Not Good: grain/earthy/wet wood
 - Light #2: DTR: 40/38/22  over 8:30; Better: fruit/citrus/grain/wood
 - Light #3: DTR: 43/42/16  over 10:35; Best; fruit/citrus/orange/floral
 - Longer can be light, with good ROR control.
 - **NOTE** Reduce Charge temp, dont *race* into FC
 - **NOTE** Reduce heating levels until FCs lower levels for smaller batches.
 - Follow same milestones. Devel 1-2.5 minutes; Control Devel after FCs.
 - **NOTE** Reduce heat *way* before FCs not during
 - Adjust heat levels per batch weight (smaller heat for smaller batches)

## Troubleshooting Roasting Profiles

 - Profile: how coffee is roasted: for consistency, control, quality, keep/share info.
 - Plan vs. Actual.  Profile curve from software (graph from Artisan)
 - Before Roasting: Ambient temp, Humidity, Batch#, Examine Defects, Bean Moisture, Color
 - Bean quality: Defects, Moisture, Color (new=green, old=gray/cinnamon)
 - **NOTE** SCA Form is standard for Green Coffee Eval. use this or similar
 - During Roasting: Track temps, color, FC, SC, Heat/Air events
 - Various Machines might show FC, SC temps different (probs, air, varience)
 - Heat Soak 10% 1 min, then 70% 5 mins, 35% 2 mins, 20% through FC, SC (no change during FC)
 - Heat Soak 0% 1 min, then 20% 1 min, 35% (get ROR=20F)
 - **NOTE** have good way to smell roasting (sniff top hopper? or vent?)
 - Sniff/Smell for Aroma "A" Point just before 1st crack.
 - Flick/Crash: At FC, bump up Temp, then crash. (lower temp just before FC to avoid)
 - Beware of chasing Crash with Recovery spike (from overcompensated bump in temp)
 - Baked Example:  flat ROR, 12:30 mins;
 - Scorched: dark spots, burned on metal drum. char flavors. (low density scorch easily)
 - Tipped, cracks on ends. biscuit/cereal or skunk flavor. lower RPM.
 - Chipped, too much heat, expand too fast, piece blown off.  lower heat.
 - Baked, light, dull or no flavor.
 - Uneven Moisture;  too much heat, uneven drying. soft beans can expand too fast.
 - Over developed, over roasted (dark shiny), burnt (oily)
 - Maillard (BRN): lower temp, longer roast, too long (7-9 mins) makes bitter, reduces sugars
 - Carmelizaation (DEVEL): higher temp. less time before/after FC, sugars, too short makes sour,
 - Structural Changes: Mass lost (13-22%) Volume Increase (30-100%)
 - Change Density green beans 500-700 g/L to roasted 350-450 g/L (most drastic in Dark, fast roasted coffee)
 - Acids break down (citric, malik, lactic, acetic, quinic)
