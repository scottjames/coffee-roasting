## AI notes about roasting small batches

For small-batch roasting (150 g in your 500 g drum), the **Rate of Rise (RoR)** schedule is what keeps the roast tasting developed (sweet, rich) rather than baked or ashy.

Because electric roasters react slowly, you want to **set up a smooth declining RoR** in advance. Here’s a good **target RoR schedule** (°C/min, approximate) for a **dark roast dropped 30–45 sec into 2C**:

## Target RoR Curve for 150 g Dark Roast

| Phase / Time marker                    | Target RoR (°C/min) | Notes                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Turning point (\~1:00)**             | 20–25               | Strong rebound, full heat.                                   |
| **Drying end (\~3:30)**                | 15–18               | Beans yellow, keep momentum.                                 |
| **Mid-Maillard (\~5:00)**              | 12–14               | Start gentle decline.                                        |
| **First crack start (\~7:30–8:00)**    | 9–11                | Avoid crash — don’t let RoR dip below \~8.                   |
| **Mid-development (\~9:00)**           | 7–9                 | Smooth decline, sweetness builds.                            |
| **Second crack start (\~10:00–10:30)** | 6–7                 | Enough energy to enter 2C cleanly.                           |
| **Drop (\~10:30–11:15)**               | 4–6                 | Declining but still positive. Don’t let RoR flatten to zero. |

### Key Takeaways

* **Declining, never flat**: RoR should steadily fall, but not crash. Flat/near-zero = baked flavors.
* **Momentum into 2C**: Enter 2C with at least 6 °C/min. Too low and you risk flat/bready cup. Too high and you risk tipping/burnt notes.
* **Short time in 2C**: Keep \~30–45 sec. If RoR is still >6 when you hit 2C, you’ll have plenty of control to finish cleanly.
