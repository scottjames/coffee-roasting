In home roasting, a sour taste is almost exclusively a sign of **underdevelopment**.

While "acidity" is a desirable trait in specialty coffee (providing fruity or floral brightness), "sourness" is a defect. It tastes sharp, grassy, salty, or puckering—like biting into a raw potato or an unripe lemon.

This happens because the organic acids in the bean (primarily chlorogenic, citric, and malic acids) did not have enough time or heat to degrade into sugars and balanced distinct flavors.

Here is what causes sourness based on roasting phases, times, and temperatures.

### 1. The Roasting Phases

The most common culprit for sourness is how you handle the transition from the start of the roast to the end of the "First Crack."

* **Drying Phase (Green to Yellow):**
* **The Issue:** If you rush this phase with too much heat too quickly, the outside of the bean cooks while the inside remains raw. This is known as "scorching" or "tipping," but the internal result is a sour, grassy core.
* **The Fix:** You need enough conductive heat to penetrate the core of the bean before the outside burns. This ensures the entire bean develops evenly later on.


* **Maillard Phase (Yellow to First Crack):**
* **The Issue:** This is where sugars begin to brown and complex savory/sweet flavors form. If this phase is too fast (a "steep" curve), you preserve too many aggressive acids without creating the sugar browning needed to balance them out.
* **The Fix:** Slowing down slightly here helps mute sharp acidity and build body.


* **Development Phase (Post-First Crack):**
* **The Issue:** **This is the #1 cause of sourness.** If you end the roast too soon after the First Crack begins, the chemical reactions haven't finished. The heat hasn't fully penetrated the center of the bean to break down the chlorogenic acids.
* **The Fix:** You need to extend the time the beans spend *after* the cracking starts, even for light roasts.



### 2. Times (The "DTR" Rule)

Roasters often use the **Development Time Ratio (DTR)** to diagnose sourness. DTR is the percentage of the total roast time spent in the Development Phase (from the start of First Crack to the end of the roast).

* **The Danger Zone (<15%):** If your First Crack starts at 8:00 and you dump the beans at 8:45, your development time is only 45 seconds. This is likely too short for most setups, resulting in hollow, sour, or vegetal coffee.
* **The Target (20-25%):** For a balanced roast that preserves good acidity without the sour defect, aim for the development phase to be roughly 20% to 25% of your total roast time.

### 3. Temperature

* **Drop Temperature (End Temp):**
* If you pull the beans at a temperature that is too low (e.g., stopping immediately when you hear the first distinct *pop*), the bean has not reached the internal temperature required to caramelize sugars.
* **Rule of Thumb:** You generally want to finish the roast *after* the rolling First Crack has mostly finished (for a light/medium roast), typically ensuring the bean mass reaches a temperature between **400°F (205°C) and 415°F (212°C)** depending on your probe placement and machine.


* **Rate of Rise (RoR) Crash:**
* If your temperature "crashes" (stops rising or drops) right as First Crack begins, the energy leaves the beans. The roast stalls, and you end up with "baked" sourness—a flat, sour-dough-like flavor because the acids didn't degrade properly.



### Summary Checklist for Sour Coffee

If your coffee is sour, check these three variables first:

1. **Development Time:** Was the time *after* the crack started less than 1 minute? (Likely too short).
2. **Color Uniformity:** Are the beans uneven? (Some dark, some very light/tan). This implies the heat application was too uneven or fast.
3. **Drop Temp:** Did you pull it *during* the peak of the crack? (Too early).

**Would you like to share your typical total roast time and drop temperature? I can help you calculate your DTR to see if that's the issue.**

` how to adjust for 500g roaster using IR heater instead of conventional drum roaster. `


Roasting with an infrared (IR) heater (like a Kaleido Sniper or similar electric IR drum) is fundamentally different from a conventional gas/air roaster.

If you are getting sourness with IR, it is usually because **IR energy is incredibly efficient at heating the surface of the bean, but it takes time to conduct to the center.**

This creates a "False Positive": The outside of the bean looks roast-ready, and your probe might say you hit First Crack, but the center is still raw (underdeveloped).

Here is how to adjust your 500g IR profile to fix the sourness.

### 1. The "Soak" Strategy (Crucial for IR)

In a gas roaster, you often charge hot to compensate for the drum cooling down. In IR, the elements respond instantly. If you hit cold beans with 100% IR power immediately, you scorch the outside and seal the inside, trapping the sour acids.

* **The Fix:** Implement a "Soak" phase.
* **How to do it:**
* **Charge Temp:** Lower your charge temp to around **160°C - 170°C (320°F - 340°F)** (lower than the typical 200°C for gas).
* **Initial Power:** When you drop the beans, turn the heat to **0% or very low (10-20%)** for the first **45–60 seconds**.
* **Why:** This allows the bean temperature and drum temperature to equalize gently before you blast them with radiant energy. This ensures the heat penetrates the core *before* the surface starts browning.



### 2. Extend the "Middle" (Maillard Phase)

IR roasters are very fast in the middle phase (Yellow to Crack). If this phase flies by in 3 minutes, you will have sour coffee. The chemical reactions that break down sour acids take *time*, not just heat.

* **The Fix:** Reduce power earlier.
* **How to do it:**
* In a conventional roaster, you might keep power high until First Crack.
* In an IR roaster, **drop your power significantly** (e.g., from 80% to 50-60%) as soon as the beans turn yellow/tan (approx 150°C / 300°F).
* Aim to stretch this yellow-to-crack phase to at least **4:00 to 5:00 minutes**.



### 3. Trust Your Ears, Not the Probe

Many IR roasters use sensors that can be influenced by the IR light itself, or they read the surface temperature of the bean rather than the air mass. This means your "First Crack" reading on the screen might be 5–10°C higher or lower than reality.

* **The Fix:** Ignore the target temperature number you see online for gas roasters.
* **Action:** If your screen says 205°C but you haven't heard a rolling crack, **do not drop.** Wait for the audible rolling crack. In IR roasting, you often need to roast *slightly* darker by color/sight to get the same internal development as a gas roaster.

### 4. Sample Profile for 500g IR Roaster (Anti-Sour)

* **Charge:** 165°C
* **0:00 - 1:00:** Heat 10% (Soak)
* **1:00 - 5:00 (Drying):** Heat 80-90% (Get energy into the bean)
* **5:00 (Yellowing):** Drop Heat to 60%. (Slow it down so the inside catches up).
* **8:30 (First Crack Start):** You want crack to happen later than usual. If it cracks at 7:00, you are going too fast.
* **Development:** Hold for 2:00 to 2:30 minutes after the crack starts.
* **Drop:** Visually, it might look slightly darker than you are used to.

### Quick Diagnostic

* **Sour + Grassy:** You rushed the beginning. Use the "Soak" method.
* **Sour + Salty:** You rushed the middle. Lower the heat at the Yellow stage.

**Next Step:** Would you like to try a "Soak" profile on your next batch? If you tell me your typical First Crack time, I can give you exact power settings to try.
