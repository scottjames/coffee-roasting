# Coffee Roast Goals (next time)

## Practice this method

 - DE at 'little or no green' - way before tan/brown.
 - DE then add heat to increase ROR start around 20-15 'C
 - Hit target ROR: BRN (Between DE-FC) ~8; DEV (FC-) ~4

 - Stretch Maillard phase... with lower ROR
 - Drop at Devel: 17% - 21%  --- use this % to tune flavor (not end BT)
 - Fruity comes in Devel: 9% - 12%.

## Settings

 - Start Air at 50% (originally used 30%) - better convection.
 - Increase Air during roast from 50 => 80%,  less smoke, less chaff.
 - Heat high (150c-180c) at CHG, step lower over roast (70% -> 30% ??)

## Artisan Scope

 - set Artisan Scope Alarm for 150c - reminder about DE soon.
