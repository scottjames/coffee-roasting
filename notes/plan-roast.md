# Planning a roast for unknown beans

Notes from James Wilkins video:

## Beans

- use same batch size every time
- use same charge temperature, only vary for big external temperature (winter air)
- change other variables with air, heat and times.
- consider internal temperature/humidity and outdoor air conditions.
- consider your mood, if rushed and upset, it will show poor quality work.

## Dry
- cultivar determines temperature profile.
- Dry phase is all temperatures under 160c

## Maillard
- cultivar determines temperature profile.
- aim for 16c increase per minute after hitting 160c (dry end)
- build persistent and proportionate pressure inside bean.
- too little pressure makes under developed, slow first crack.
- too much pressure makes over developed, runaway first crack, might burn beans.

## First Crack and Development
- when water vapor is released
- cultivar and process method plays into development time and profile
- washed process coffee uses more development time.
- natural process coffee uses less development time.
- process method is linked to development time.
- for example, a 9:25 roast, might use around 1:20 development time for balanced roast.
- choose the end temperature, which determines and locks in the chemistry.
- lower end temperature has brighter acid, fruity notes lighter body.
- higher end temperature has complex body and texture.
- percent loss describes profile.
- loss 12% is light profile
- loss 14% is medium profile

## Summary
- Use same batch size and charge temp.
- Consider dry phase based on cultivar of coffee.
- Consider process method plays into developement after first crack.
- Choose drop temp
- Use percent loss as a guide to tune for next roast.
- Choose a design, choose lighter or darker to taste.
